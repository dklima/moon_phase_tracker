## 🎭 Lunar Adventures Await

*Time to dance with the moon phases like a cosmic choreographer!*

### 🌟 The Essential Four - Your Lunar Greatest Hits

*Start your journey with the moon's main characters: the celestial quartet that's been stealing hearts since ancient times.*

```ruby
require 'moon_phase_tracker'

# Moon phases for August 2025 (4 major phases only)
phases = MoonPhaseTracker.phases_for_month(2025, 8)
puts phases.first.to_s
# => "🌑 New Moon - 2025-08-04 at 11:13"
# (Perfect timing for new beginnings!)

# All phases for 2025 - your yearly lunar roadmap
year_phases = MoonPhaseTracker.phases_for_year(2025)

# Next 6 phases from a specific date - peek into the future
future_phases = MoonPhaseTracker.phases_from_date("2025-08-01", 6)
```

### 🎨 The Full Lunar Canvas - All 8 Phases in Their Glory

*For the lunar perfectionists who want the complete story, not just the highlights reel.*

```ruby
require 'moon_phase_tracker'

# All 8 phases for August 2025 - the complete lunar symphony
all_phases = MoonPhaseTracker.all_phases_for_month(2025, 8)
all_phases.each do |phase|
  indicator = phase.interpolated ? "~ " : "  "  # ~ means "calculated with love"
  puts "#{indicator}#{phase}"
end
# =>   🌑 New Moon - 2025-08-04 at 11:13
# => ~ 🌒 Waxing Crescent - 2025-08-08 at 03:16
# =>   🌓 First Quarter - 2025-08-12 at 15:19
# => ~ 🌔 Waxing Gibbous - 2025-08-15 at 16:53
# =>   🌕 Full Moon - 2025-08-19 at 18:26
# => ~ 🌖 Waning Gibbous - 2025-08-22 at 13:56 
# =>   🌗 Last Quarter - 2025-08-26 at 09:26
# => ~ 🌘 Waning Crescent - 2025-08-29 at 02:56

# All 8 phases for entire year - your cosmic annual planner
all_year_phases = MoonPhaseTracker.all_phases_for_year(2025)

# All 8 phases from specific date (2 lunar cycles) - the extended edition
extended_phases = MoonPhaseTracker.all_phases_from_date("2025-08-01", 2)
```

#### Filtering Intermediate Phases

To extract only the 4 calculated intermediate phases from a month:

```ruby
require 'moon_phase_tracker'

begin
  all_phases = MoonPhaseTracker.all_phases_for_month(2025, 8)
rescue MoonPhaseTracker::NetworkError, MoonPhaseTracker::APIError => e
  puts "API unavailable: #{e.message}"
  all_phases = []
end

interpolated = all_phases.select(&:interpolated)

interpolated.each do |phase|
  puts "#{phase.symbol} #{phase.name} — #{phase.formatted_date} (source: #{phase.source})"
end
# => 🌒 Waxing Crescent — 2025-08-08 (source: interpolated)
# => 🌔 Waxing Gibbous — 2025-08-15 (source: interpolated)
# => 🌖 Waning Gibbous — 2025-08-22 (source: interpolated)
# => 🌘 Waning Crescent — 2025-08-29 (source: interpolated)
```

**Edge cases to handle:**
- A month at the boundary of the USNO data range may return fewer than 4 major phases, which means fewer interpolated phases (or none)
- `all_phases_for_month` can return between 4 and 8 phases depending on how many intermediate phases fall within the calendar month
- The `interpolated` attribute is always `false` for API phases and `true` for calculated intermediates — there's no ambiguous state

**Dependencies:** The gem requires Ruby >= 3.2.0. Install via `gem install moon_phase_tracker` or add `gem 'moon_phase_tracker'` to your Gemfile. No external services needed for `LunarCalculator` methods; only the `phases_for_*` and `all_phases_for_*` methods require network access to the USNO API.

### 🔮 Instant Moon Phase - No API, No Waiting

*What phase is the moon right now? How bright is it? Pure math, instant answer.*

These methods use a synodic month calculation — no API calls, no network, no rate limits. Perfect for display UIs and real-time widgets.

```ruby
require 'moon_phase_tracker'

# What's the moon doing right now?
phase = MoonPhaseTracker.current_phase
puts phase.to_s
# => "🌔 Waxing Gibbous - 2025-08-15 at 14:30"
puts phase.illumination  # => 78.5 (percent)
puts phase.lunar_age     # => 12.3 (days since last new moon)
puts phase.source        # => :calculated

# Phase at any date/time - past or future
phase = MoonPhaseTracker.phase_at(Time.utc(2025, 6, 11, 7, 44))
puts phase.name          # => "Full Moon"
puts phase.illumination  # => ~100.0

# Just the illumination percentage
illum = MoonPhaseTracker.illumination(Date.today)
puts "#{illum.round(1)}% illuminated"

# Works with Date, Time, DateTime, or String
MoonPhaseTracker.phase_at(Date.new(2025, 1, 15))
MoonPhaseTracker.phase_at("2025-01-15")
MoonPhaseTracker.phase_at(DateTime.now)
```

> **Accuracy note:** The synodic model gives the correct named phase ~99% of the time. Within ~6 hours of a phase boundary, it may differ from USNO API data. The API path gives precision for scheduling; the calculator path gives instant answers for display.

### 🎯 The Tracker Class - Your Personal Lunar Assistant

*Think of it as your moon phase butler, always ready to serve up cosmic timing with a bow tie.*

```ruby
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new

# Automatic formatting for display - because presentation matters
august_phases = tracker.phases_for_month(2025, 8)
formatted = tracker.format_phases(august_phases, "August Phases")
puts formatted

# Next moon phase - your cosmic fortune telling
next_phase = tracker.next_phase
puts next_phase.to_s

# Current month phases - what's happening in your lunar neighborhood
current_month = tracker.current_month_phases

# Instant phase at any date - no API call needed
phase = tracker.phase_at("2025-06-11")
puts phase.illumination  # => Float (percent)

# Just the illumination number
illum = tracker.illumination("2025-06-11")

# Current phase right now
puts tracker.current_phase
```

### 🔍 Getting Personal with Moon Phases

*Each phase has its own personality - let's get to know them intimately.*

```ruby
phase = phases.first

# Phase information
puts phase.name          # "New Moon"
puts phase.symbol        # "🌑" (isn't it beautiful?)
puts phase.formatted_date # "2025-08-04"
puts phase.formatted_time # "11:13" (UTC - the moon doesn't do timezones)
puts phase.interpolated   # false (certified genuine USNO data)

# Working with interpolated phases - the mathematically gifted ones
interpolated_phase = all_phases.find(&:interpolated)
puts interpolated_phase.interpolated  # true (calculated with mathematical precision)
puts interpolated_phase.name         # "Waxing Crescent"
puts interpolated_phase.symbol       # "🌒" (still adorable)

# Complete hash with all data
details = phase.to_h
# => {
#   name: "New Moon",
#   phase_type: :new_moon,
#   date: "2025-08-04",
#   time: "11:13",
#   symbol: "🌑",
#   iso_date: "2025-08-04",
#   utc_time: "2025-08-04T11:13:00Z",
#   interpolated: false,
#   source: :api,           # :api, :interpolated, or :calculated
#   illumination: nil,      # Float for calculated phases, nil for API
#   lunar_age: nil          # Float for calculated phases, nil for API
# }

# Date checks - lunar detective work
phase.in_month?(2025, 8)  # => true (August moon confirmed!)
phase.in_year?(2025)      # => true (definitely a 2025 vintage)
```

### 🛡️ When the Moon Plays Hard to Get

*Even celestial bodies have bad days. Here's how to handle lunar tantrums gracefully.*

All errors inherit from `MoonPhaseTracker::Error`, so you can rescue broadly or specifically:

| Error Class | Raised When | Example Trigger |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `NetworkError` | Connection timeout, DNS failure, socket error | USNO API is down, no internet |
| `APIError` | Non-200 response or invalid JSON from the API | 500 server error, malformed response |
| `InvalidDateError` | Input validation fails before any API call | Month 13, year 1500, unparseable string |

```ruby
begin
  phases = MoonPhaseTracker.phases_for_month(2025, 8)
rescue MoonPhaseTracker::NetworkError => e
  puts "Network hiccup: #{e.message}"
rescue MoonPhaseTracker::APIError => e
  puts "API tantrum: #{e.message}"
rescue MoonPhaseTracker::InvalidDateError => e
  puts "Time travel error: #{e.message}"
end
```

Since `LunarCalculator` is pure math (no network), it makes a natural fallback when the API is unavailable:

```ruby
def moon_phases_for(year, month)
  MoonPhaseTracker.all_phases_for_month(year, month)
rescue MoonPhaseTracker::NetworkError, MoonPhaseTracker::APIError
  # API down — generate approximate phases from the calculator
  first_day = Date.new(year, month, 1)
  last_day = first_day.next_month - 1
  calculator = MoonPhaseTracker::LunarCalculator.new

  (first_day..last_day).each_with_object([]) do |date, phases|
    phase = calculator.phase_at(date)
    prev = phases.last
    phases << phase if prev.nil? || prev.name != phase.name
  end
end
```

The fallback returns one Phase per named transition in the month. The `source` field will be `:calculated` instead of `:api`, so downstream code can distinguish degraded results.

### 🎪 Real-World Lunar Magic

*Because theory is nice, but seeing the moon phases in action is where the real magic happens.*

#### Hybrid Architecture: USNO for Scheduling, Calculator for Display

The API gives you exact dates. The calculator gives you instant answers. Use both — a background job populates a `lunar_phases` table with USNO data, and `LunarCalculator` handles the real-time display layer.

```ruby
# app/jobs/sync_lunar_phases_job.rb
class SyncLunarPhasesJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(year = Date.current.year)
    phases = MoonPhaseTracker.all_phases_for_year(year)

    phases.each do |phase|
      LunarPhase.upsert(
        {
          name: phase.name,
          phase_type: phase.phase_type.to_s,
          exact_at: phase.to_h[:utc_time],
          source: phase.source.to_s
        },
        unique_by: :exact_at
      )
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/lunar_phase.rb
class LunarPhase < ApplicationRecord
  scope :upcoming, -> { where("exact_at > ?", Time.current).order(:exact_at) }
  scope :next_full_moon, -> { upcoming.where(phase_type: "full_moon").first }
end
```

```ruby
# app/helpers/moon_helper.rb
module MoonHelper
  def moon_badge(date = Date.current)
    phase = MoonPhaseTracker.phase_at(date)
    "#{phase.symbol} #{phase.illumination.round}%"
  end
end
```

Two data sources, each doing what they do best. The table owns scheduling precision (notifications, rituals, content triggers). The calculator owns display (emoji, illumination percentage, "what phase is it right now?"). They never step on each other's toes.

See the `examples/usage_example.rb` and `examples/eight_phases_example.rb` files for more usage examples.

### 🏷️ Phase Sources - Know Where Your Data Comes From

*Every phase carries a passport stamped with its origin story.*

| Source | Meaning | When |
|--------|---------|------|
| `:api` | Official USNO data | `phases_for_month`, `phases_for_year`, etc. |
| `:interpolated` | Calculated between two API phases | `all_phases_for_month`, `all_phases_for_year`, etc. |
| `:calculated` | Pure synodic math model | `phase_at`, `illumination`, `current_phase` |

```ruby
phase = MoonPhaseTracker.phase_at(Date.today)
phase.source        # => :calculated
phase.illumination  # => 65.3 (percent)
phase.lunar_age     # => 10.2 (days since last new moon)
```

### 🔬 Accuracy & Validation

#### Interpolated Phases — Known Limitations

The 4 intermediate phases (Waxing Crescent, Waxing Gibbous, Waning Gibbous, Waning Crescent) are **not** from the USNO API. They're calculated by splitting the time interval between two consecutive major phases in half.

This approach assumes **uniform phase spacing** within each quarter of the lunar cycle. In reality, the Moon's orbit is elliptical — it moves faster at perigee and slower at apogee. The practical consequences:

| Limitation | Impact | Magnitude |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Phase timing error | Interpolated dates can drift from true astronomical timing | Up to ~12 hours |
| Illumination gap | The calculator's cosine model smooths over orbital eccentricity | ~2-5% near quarter phases |
| Boundary misclassification | Near phase transitions, the named phase may differ from USNO | Within ~6 hours of boundaries |
| No libration modeling | The synodic model ignores lunar libration and perturbations | Negligible for phase naming |

**For precision-critical applications** (astronomical scheduling, scientific observations, tidal calculations), always use the `:api` source phases. The interpolated and calculated paths are designed for **display and UX** — calendars, widgets, badges, content scheduling.

#### Calculator (Synodic Model) — What It Can and Can't Do

The `LunarCalculator` uses a fixed synodic month of 29.530588853 days anchored to a known New Moon epoch (January 6, 2000, 18:14 UTC). It gives you:

- **Correct named phase ~99% of the time** — the 8 phase boundaries divide the cycle into equal 1/8th arcs
- **Illumination via cosine curve** — `(1 - cos(2π × fraction)) / 2` approximates the visual illumination percentage
- **Instant results for any date from 1800 to 2100** — no network, no rate limits

What it doesn't model: orbital eccentricity, solar perturbations, atmospheric refraction, or the equation of time. These factors accumulate over centuries, so dates far from the epoch will drift more.

#### Validating Against USNO Data

You can cross-check any calculated phase against the authoritative API data:

```ruby
require 'moon_phase_tracker'

date = Date.new(2025, 8, 19)

# Calculator path (instant, approximate)
calc = MoonPhaseTracker.phase_at(date)

# API path (network call, authoritative)
api_phases = MoonPhaseTracker.phases_for_month(2025, 8)
api = api_phases.find { |p| p.date == date }

if api
  puts "Calculator: #{calc.name} (#{calc.illumination.round(1)}%)"
  puts "USNO API:   #{api.name}"
  puts "Phase match: #{calc.name == api.name}"
  puts "Date delta:  #{(calc.date - api.date).to_i} days"
end
```

For systematic validation, compare an entire year's calculated phases against API data:

```ruby
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new
api_phases = tracker.phases_for_year(2025)
calculator = MoonPhaseTracker::LunarCalculator.new

mismatches = api_phases.count do |api_phase|
  calc_phase = calculator.phase_at(api_phase.date)
  calc_phase.name != api_phase.name
end

accuracy = ((api_phases.size - mismatches).to_f / api_phases.size * 100).round(1)
puts "#{accuracy}% phase name accuracy (#{mismatches}/#{api_phases.size} mismatches)"
```

### 📦 Multi-Year Queries, Caching, and Rate Limits

#### What the Gem Caches (and What It Doesn't)

The `Client` has one internal cache: `@uri_cache`, keyed by endpoint + params. It caches **parsed URI objects**, not API responses. Calling `phases_for_year(2025)` twice on the same `Tracker` instance reuses the parsed URI but makes two network requests.

The gem has **no built-in response cache**. This is intentional — caching strategy depends on your application (Redis, Memcached, database, in-memory), so it belongs in your layer.

#### Avoiding Redundant API Calls for the Same Month

`phases_for_month(year, month)` internally calls `phases_for_year(year)` and filters by month. This means querying January, February, and March of 2025 makes **three identical API calls** to the same year endpoint:

```ruby
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new

# BAD: 3 API calls for the same year
jan = tracker.phases_for_month(2025, 1)
feb = tracker.phases_for_month(2025, 2)
mar = tracker.phases_for_month(2025, 3)
```

Fetch the year once and filter locally:

```ruby
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new

# GOOD: 1 API call, filter in Ruby
all_2025 = tracker.phases_for_year(2025)
jan = all_2025.select { |p| p.in_month?(2025, 1) }
feb = all_2025.select { |p| p.in_month?(2025, 2) }
mar = all_2025.select { |p| p.in_month?(2025, 3) }
```

The same applies to `all_phases_for_month` — use `all_phases_for_year` once and filter.

#### Rate Limiter Scope

The rate limiter is **per-Tracker instance**. Each `Tracker.new` creates its own `Client` with its own token bucket. Multiple trackers (e.g. one per background worker) each enforce their own rate limit independently.

#### Multi-Year Strategy

The USNO API returns all phases for a given year in a single response (~50 phases per year). Querying 10 years means 10 API calls, not 120 month-by-month calls. Use `phases_for_year` as the batch unit:

```ruby
# Efficient: 1 API call per year, rate limiter spaces them automatically
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new

phases_by_year = (2020..2030).each_with_object({}) do |year, acc|
  acc[year] = tracker.all_phases_for_year(year)
end

# 11 API calls total, ~11 seconds at default rate (1 req/sec)
# Each year returns ~50 phases (major) or ~100 phases (all 8)
```

For faster bulk loading, increase the rate limit:

```ruby
fast_limiter = MoonPhaseTracker::RateLimiter.new(
  requests_per_second: 3.0,
  burst_size: 3
)
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new(rate_limiter: fast_limiter)

# Same 11 calls, now ~4 seconds
(2020..2030).each { |year| tracker.phases_for_year(year) }
```

#### Adding a Response Cache

Lunar data is static per year, so a long TTL works well. A pattern with Rails:

```ruby
class LunarDataService
  def phases_for_year(year)
    Rails.cache.fetch("lunar_phases/#{year}", expires_in: 30.days) do
      MoonPhaseTracker.all_phases_for_year(year).map(&:to_h)
    end
  end

  def phases_for_range(start_year, end_year)
    (start_year..end_year).flat_map { |year| phases_for_year(year) }
  end
end
```

This gives you: one API call per year, cached for 30 days, rate-limited automatically. The `to_h` serialization ensures the cache stores plain hashes (safe for any cache backend).

#### Combining API and Calculator for Multi-Year Systems

For applications that span multiple years, the recommended architecture:

| Time Range | Source | Why |
|------------|--------|-----|
| Historical data (past years) | API, cached in database | Exact dates, fetch once, query forever |
| Current year | API, cached with shorter TTL | Re-fetch quarterly to catch USNO updates |
| Real-time display | `LunarCalculator` | No network, no cache, instant |
| Far future (> 10 years out) | `LunarCalculator` | USNO API range is limited |

The database-backed approach from the [Hybrid Architecture](#hybrid-architecture-usno-for-scheduling-calculator-for-display) example works across years — run the sync job once per year for each new year, and the `lunar_phases` table grows by ~100 rows annually.

## ⚓ Our Trusted Cosmic Oracle

*We get our lunar wisdom from the finest source - the folks who navigate the seven seas by the stars.*

This gem uses the official US Naval Observatory (USNO) API - because when it comes to celestial navigation, you want the folks who've been steering ships by the stars for centuries:

- **Base URL**: https://aa.usno.navy.mil/api/moon/phases/
- **API Version**: 4.0.1 (battle-tested and Navy-approved)
- **Documentation**: https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/api

All times are provided in Universal Time (UTC) - because the moon doesn't care about your timezone preferences, and neither should precise astronomical data.

## 🚦 Playing Nice with the Navy - Rate Limiting with Style

*Because even cosmic APIs need coffee breaks, and we're not monsters.*

Think of rate limiting as the polite pause between questions when chatting with a wise oracle. We implement respectful rate limiting to keep the USNO Navy API happy (and responsive). By default, we're as patient as a monk - **1 request per second** with the restraint of a zen master.


### 🧘 The Zen Approach - Default Rate Limiting

*Slow and steady wins the lunar race.*

```ruby
# Default: 1 request per second - the patient approach
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new

# Check current rate limit configuration - know thy limits
puts tracker.rate_limit_info
# => {:requests_per_second=>1.0, :burst_size=>1, :available_tokens=>1}

# Multiple requests will be automatically rate limited - watch the magic
start = Time.now
tracker.phases_for_year(2025)  # Immediate (first one's free!)
tracker.phases_for_year(2024)  # Waits ~1 second (patience, young padawan)
puts "Total time: #{Time.now - start}s"  # ~1.0 seconds
```

### ⚡ Need for Speed? - Custom Rate Limiting

*For when you want to live life in the fast lane (but still be respectful).*

```ruby
# Create custom rate limiter: 3 requests per second, burst of 2 - living a little
rate_limiter = MoonPhaseTracker::RateLimiter.new(
  requests_per_second: 3.0,
  burst_size: 2
)

tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new(rate_limiter: rate_limiter)

# Burst requests are immediate, then rate limited - controlled excitement
tracker.phases_for_year(2025)  # Immediate (wheee!)
tracker.phases_for_year(2024)  # Immediate (double wheee!)
tracker.phases_for_year(2023)  # Waits ~0.33 seconds (and... breathe)
```

### 🌍 Set It and Forget It - Environment Variables

*Configure once, smile forever.*

```ruby
# Set via environment variables - the lazy developer's paradise
ENV["MOON_PHASE_RATE_LIMIT"] = "2.5"
ENV["MOON_PHASE_BURST_SIZE"] = "3"

tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new
puts tracker.rate_limit_info
# => {:requests_per_second=>2.5, :burst_size=>3, :available_tokens=>3}
```

### 🏁 Living Dangerously - Disabling Rate Limiting

*For the rebels and the reckless (use responsibly, dear lunar adventurer).*

```ruby
# Disable rate limiting completely - for the speed demons
ENV["MOON_PHASE_RATE_LIMIT"] = "0"

tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new
puts tracker.rate_limit_info  # => nil (no limits, no safety net!)

# Or pass nil explicitly - the explicit rebel
tracker = MoonPhaseTracker::Tracker.new(rate_limiter: nil)
```

### 🔬 Under the Hood - Rate Limit Monitoring

*For the control freaks and performance enthusiasts among us.*

```ruby
rate_limiter = MoonPhaseTracker::RateLimiter.new(
  requests_per_second: 1.0,
  burst_size: 2

### 🪣 The Magic Behind the Curtain - Token Bucket Algorithm

*The elegant dance of digital tokens that keeps everything flowing smoothly.*

The rate limiter uses a token bucket algorithm:

- **Tokens**: Represent available requests
- **Bucket Size**: Maximum burst requests allowed
- **Refill Rate**: How quickly tokens are replenished
- **Thread Safe**: Handles concurrent requests safely

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies (like preparing your lunar laboratory). Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests (because even moon phases need quality control). You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment (perfect for midnight coding sessions under the actual moon).

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org) (sharing lunar magic with the world!).
